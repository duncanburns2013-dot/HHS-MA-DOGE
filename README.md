## The Money Cycle

```
Workers (71,000) pay mandatory dues ($10M+/yr)
    → Union PACs ($14.09M — 1199SEIU alone)
        → Democratic legislators (Mariano, Spilka, Michlewitz)
            → Ch.257 rate increases (auto-escalation, no review)
                → Nonprofit CEO comp ($500K-$800K)
                    → Trade groups lobby for more ($7.6M/yr)
                        → Repeat. Budget: $28B → $61B.
```

**Workers got +17%. The cycle got +118%.**
