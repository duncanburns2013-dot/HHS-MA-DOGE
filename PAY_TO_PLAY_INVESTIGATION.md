# Pay-to-Play Investigation: Massachusetts Health & Human Services

**Lobbying Registry + OCPF Campaign Finance + CTHRU Vendor Payments + DOGE Medicaid Billing**

Last updated: February 15, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document cross-references four public databases to trace the political influence network surrounding Massachusetts Medicaid spending:

1. **MA Secretary of State Lobbyist Registry** — Who lobbies and how much they're paid
2. **OCPF Campaign Finance (Office of Campaign & Political Finance)** — Who donates to whom
3. **CTHRU Statewide Spending** — How much each vendor receives from the state
4. **DOGE/HHS T-MSIS Dataset** — Federal Medicaid billing by provider

**Combined findings:** $7.2M in state lobbying + ~9,000 campaign donation records + $69.8M in federal political spending — all flowing to the same handful of legislators who control a $31.6B budget that grew $1.56B in 4 years.

## Revolving Doors

Three former legislative budget leaders now lobby for entities receiving billions in state payments:

| Person | Former Role | Current Role | Annual Lobbying Pay | Client Payments |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| **Brian Dempsey** | State Rep, **House Ways & Means Chairman** (1991-2014) | Dempsey Associates LLC → BMC lobbyist | $72,000/year ($360K total) | BMC: $4,627M |
| **Steven Panagiotakos** | State Senator, **Senate Ways & Means** (1997-2011) | Vinfen Corporation lobbyist | $12K-$21K/year | Vinfen: $238M |
| **Italo Fini** | SEIU 509 in-house lobbyist (2021-2022) | FINI LLC → SEIU 509 external consultant | $37,000 (2025) | SEIU 509 budget advocacy |

The two most powerful budget-writing positions in the Massachusetts legislature — House Ways & Means Chairman and Senate Ways & Means — are both now cashing in as lobbyists for Medicaid entities.

### 5. SEIU Local 509

**The political machine — 20,000+ human service workers across DDS, DCF, DMH, DPH, MRC, DEEC, DTA, MassHealth, MCB.**

**State Lobbying: $446,108 (2021-2025)**

| Year | In-house Lobbyists | External Firm | Total |

---

### 8. Bay Cove Human Services

**State Lobbying: $138,121 (2021-2025)**

| Year | Charles Hollins | Total |
|------|----------------|-------|
| 2021 | $5,200 | $5,200 |
| 2022 | $19,405 | $19,405 |
| 2023 | $28,380 | $28,380 |
| 2024 | $40,100 | $40,100 |
| 2025 | $45,036 | $45,036 |

One in-house lobbyist whose pay grew **766% in 4 years** ($5,200 → $45,036). No external firms.

**OCPF: 257 records, $34,312**

- **William Sprague** (Executive Director): $9,740 combined → Healey, Baker, Spilka, DeLeo, Murray
- **Charles Hollins** (lobbyist + donor): $500 personally as "Advocacy Director" — dual role
- **Louis Josephson** (CEO): $500
- Notable: $6,475 to Sonia Chang-Diaz alone — unusual concentration on one legislator

---

### 9. Advocates Inc.

**CTHRU Payments:** $67M → $128M (+92%) — fastest growth rate of any major vendor

**State Lobbying: $13,116 (2021-2024)**

Jeffrey Alan Keilson ($1,300-$3,320/year) + Opal Stone ($0-$4,346/year). Minimal spend. No 2025 registration found.

**OCPF: 160 records, $31,041**

- **Diane Gould** (President/CEO): $10,750 → Baker $4,500, Healey $2,250, Spilka $1,325, Michlewitz $2,000, Dempsey $500, Sanchez $1,000 — hitting every budget gatekeeper

---

### 10. Tempus Unlimited — The Infrastructure Layer

**DOGE Billing:** $6.13 BILLION (two NPIs) — single largest Medicaid billing entity in Massachusetts
**CTHRU Payments:** $681M → $1,032M (+52%)
**Gap:** $5.1B between CTHRU and DOGE reveals MCO/fiscal intermediary multiplier

**Lobbying: $0** — No registered lobbyists 2021-2025
**OCPF:** Larry Spencer (CEO): $350 total ($100 House Victory Fund PAC, $250 William Galvin). Bulk of OCPF results are PCAs (Personal Care Assistants) earning $12-25/hr giving $5-$100 from own pockets.

**Key insight:** Vendors spend $800K+ lobbying because they compete for contracts. SEIU spends $450K negotiating wages. ADDP spends $250K for rate increases. But Tempus bills 25× more than Seven Hills and Vinfen combined — and spends nothing. They don't need to influence the system. They ARE the system. Fiscal intermediary sitting at toll booth collecting on every transaction.

---

### 11. ServiceNet

**CTHRU Payments:** $57M → $115M (+102%)

**Lobbying: $0** — No registration found
**OCPF: 14 records only**

- **Susan Stubbs** (CEO): Baker $400, Spilka $225 = $625 total
- **Bill Benson** (Government Relations): $500 to western MA legislators near their base

Essentially zero political infrastructure despite 102% revenue growth. Benefits from ADDP trade group lobbying and Chapter 257 rate increases.

## The Same Recipients Across All Entities

Every entity in this investigation — regardless of whether they're a vendor, union, MCO, or hospital — donates to the same people:

| Recipient | Role | Why They Matter |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Michael Rodrigues** | Senate Ways & Means Chair | Controls what goes in the budget |
| **Karen Spilka** | Senate President | Controls what comes to vote |
| **Maura Healey** | Governor | Signs the budget |
| **Ronald Mariano** | House Speaker | Controls the House |
| **Robert DeLeo** | Former House Speaker | Controlled House 2009-2020 |
| **Aaron Michlewitz** | House Ways & Means Chair | Controls House budget numbers |
| **Brian Dempsey** | Former House W&M Chair | Now BMC's paid lobbyist |
| **Andrea Joy Campbell** | Attorney General | Person who would investigate fraud |
| **Therese Murray** | Former Senate President | Controlled Senate 2007-2015 |

**Campbell receives donations from Vinfen, BMC, MGB, AFSCME, Seven Hills** — every major entity in the system donates to the person who would investigate them.

---

## The Circuit

```
1. ADDP lobbies for Chapter 257 rate increases → Legislature approves
2. Seven Hills + Vinfen + Advocates + Bay Cove get bigger contracts → 
   executives donate to Rodrigues, Spilka, Healey, Mariano, Michlewitz
3. SEIU 509 lobbies for bigger budgets → PAC gives $500 to every legislator
4. AFSCME Council 93 spends $1.1M on one lobbyist → same budget advocacy
5. BMC + MGB lobby to protect MCO pipeline → combined $4.5M in state lobbying
6. Budget grows $1.56B in 4 years
7. Tempus processes $6.13B automatically as infrastructure → no lobbying needed
8. Everyone profits EXCEPT frontline workers ($12-25/hr) and beneficiaries
9. Nobody tracks whether 75% wage pass-through is enforced
10. Repeat
```
